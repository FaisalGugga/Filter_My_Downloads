# FilterMyDownloads v1.0
**FilterMyDownloads** is designed to help you keep your download folder organized. It can sort files by date or file format and remove empty folders.

## Features

**- Automatic Organization:** Sort downloaded files into subfolders based on date or file type.

**- Empty Folder Cleanup:** Automatically detect and delete empty folders to keep your downloads directory tidy.

**- User-Friendly Interface:** Ugly command line looking. (for now)

## How to use:

1. **Download the FilterMyDownloads.exe**: Run the execution inside YOUR download folder or any way (It doesn't matter really).
   
2. **Enter your download folder location**: Inside the command line
   
3. **Select your action**: Sort your downloaded files based on date or file format or detect and delete empty folders. (The program will ask for confirmation before deleting any files or folders so don't worry.)

4. **Creates log file**: The program maintains a log file inside the download path you have selected. This log file records all actions performed by the program, providing a detailed history of file operations.
